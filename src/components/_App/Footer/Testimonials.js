                        <p>I booked their game truck and had an awesome experience. Easy to book, they confirmed the
                            event in advance and even called the morning of to reconfirm the time they would arrive.
                            They were on time, great with the kids and everyone
                            had a good time.</p>

                        <p>I used Games2U for my daughters 10 year old birthday party and it was a lot of fun for
                            the kids. The game coach was great and even the parents enjoyed the game truck. I would
                            highly recommend them.</p>
